<b>MANILA, Philippines —</b> A breathtaking collaboration between two trailblazing names from Cebu — fine jewelry brand Diagold and haute couturier Cary Santiago — was held at the Shangri-La the Fort on September 11.<br><br>
“We believe in the brilliance of Filipino-made. And we believe that our stories told through jewelry, fabric and form deserve to be seen and admired,” said Jennifer Ty, Diagold’s chief executive officer, in her welcome remarks.<br><br>
“We are just so honored to share this stage with Cary Santiago and to support a designer who has long uplifted Filipino talent with quiet power and bold artistry,” Ty stressed. “At its heart, this night is a celebration of what makes us truly Filipino. It's our creativity, our craftsmanship, and our deep love for beauty and meaning.”<br><br>
“I am presenting 50 couture pieces, so it's very important for me to present the design first, to the creatives of the brand. And I'm so happy that they perfectly match,” shared the country’s finest practitioner of high fashion, in a video montage. “We had a consultation together. I submitted my designs, and I was specific with how the jewelry would match a specific garment.”<br><br>
The brand's company was founded in 1967, with it going full blast in 2008 catering to the Cebu market. Its name is derived from two distinct words: diamond and gold, forming lustrous diamond pieces in 14k and 18k gold settings.<br><br>
Santiago, on the other hand, made his spectacular comeback in 2004, after successful stints in the Middle East.<br><br>
“This collaboration feels deeply personal,” shared Santiago in a statement. “Both of us are rooted in the same values, which are attention to detail, reverence for heritage, and a commitment to beauty that endures. To be able to create and present this collection with jewelry that was designed in harmony with the garments makes this return to the [Manila runway after a decade] even more meaningful.”<br><br>
Santiago’s fascination with fauna continued with his collection that reinterpreted wings, feathers, patterns, and animal movement through soft sculpture technique in a visually stupendous way. It melded so harmoniously with the jewelry brand's “Crown Jewels” line of “rubies in fiery crimson, sapphires in deep royal blue, emeralds in lush green, and yellow diamonds that glisten with golden light.”<br><br>
“The world is ready to see more of what we can do, and tonight is a shining example of that,” Ty enthused.
Santiago echoed the sentiment: “Definitely, we are ready for a global movement.”
