When crisp fall weather begins creeping in, one phrase instantly comes to mind: cozy season.<br><br>
Every October, right around this time, I suddenly begin desiring things that are only snuggly or comfort-oriented. That could be drinking a nice warm pumpkin latte, or wrapping a huge scarf around my neck to keep me warm, Lenny Kravitz-style. I vehemently hate the cold—so much so that dressing for warmth trumps any other fashion interests for the time being. (On the streets, you can catch me looking like a layered-up Michelin Man until the spring.) That being said, street style stars from this past fashion month have proved that bundling up can still be chic.<br><br>
It’s a surprisingly-cool breakout piece of the season. Because let’s be real: When you think of a plaid flannel, you usually think of some lumberjack out in the woods, or something you throw on at home when your heat isn’t fully working. But per the street style set, they can feel super dressy when styled with more elevated pieces. The approaches i noticed ranged: Aboah and Fleming both styled theirs with classic light-wash jeans, giving their outfits a ’90s-grunge feel. (Fleming even went the extra mile with a polka-dot tie and moto jacket.) Others, like Jalil Johnson, went sleek by styling the shirt with a black tee and pleated black dress pants, and tons of statement jewels.<br><br>
Flannels may be having an undeniable street style moment, but it’s actually a trend that has been percolating for the past few seasons now. On the runways, labels like The Row and Bottega Veneta have been showing their luxurious takes on the plaid shirts. And brands such as God’s True Cashmere have made them their signature too, selling lavish versions for over $2,000. So, yes, it turns out, swaddling yourself in a shirt version of a blanket is possible, and the end result can look great. Thanks to the fashion world’s embrace of the humble flannel, I will now be entering cozy season—and doing so in style.<br><br>
But it was Yamamoto’s bold blue necklace that caught spectators’ eyes as it hung over his gray World Series Champion t-shirt on November 1. Happy Jewelers has already sprung into action, listing the MVP-approved piece for sale on their website, both in natural and lab-grown sapphires.<br><br>
