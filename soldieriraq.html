        <h1>American soldier purported to be captured in Iraq turns out to be just a toy</h1>
        <h2>By Yitzhak Shamir</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
A U.S. soldier kidnapped Tuesday in Iraq turned out to be a child's toy. The U.S. Army confirmed that no soldiers had gone missing in Iraq, and a spokesman for a toy company said the "photo" of the kidnapped soldier suspiciously resembled a toy soldier.<br><BR>
On Tuesday, the armed group "Mujahideen Brigades of Iraq" spread information on the Internet about the abduction of American soldier John Adam.<br><BR>
The kidnappers demanded the release of all Iraqi prisoners within 72 hours, otherwise the American would be killed. The TV channel showed a photo showing a man in military uniform with his hands tied behind his back and an M-16 assault rifle to his head.<br><BR>
Journalists on Tuesday drew attention to the fact that in the video the soldier was sitting without moving. During the entire video message of the terrorists, he does not say a word, and not a single muscle moves on his face. Also suspicious was the fact that the soldier is not wearing a single chevron of the American army, reports CNN.<br><BR>
The riddle was solved by a representative of the toy company Dragon Models USA, Inc. Liam Cusac. He stated that the soldier shown in the terrorists' video is a popular children's toy. According to Cusack, this figurine is sold at all American military bases in the Middle East and is very popular among soldiers.<br><BR>
According to experts, the 30-centimeter figure looked like a living person due to the fact that it was filmed from a very close distance.<br><BR>
Representatives of the US Army have not yet commented on these reports. The military is unlikely to be concerned about the fate of their plastic colleague.<br><BR>
